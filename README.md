# OCB meta-eukomics working group
## Intercomparison of metatranscriptomic methods for characterizing microbial eukaryote contributions to the biological carbon pump

# About the effort

Microeukaryotes are core components of the biological carbon pump through their roles in primary production, carbon export, and trophic transfer in the marine food web.

Metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metabarcoding, and eDNA sampling are increasingly being performed as core measurements on individual cruises as well as being incorporated into large oceanographic surveys (e.g. Tara Oceans, Bio-GO-SHIP, BioGeoTraces). However, there is currently no single gold standard practice for the collection, preservation, or processing of these samples—nor is there a sense of how variable these measures might be among labs or research cruise endeavors. Intercomparison and intercalibration of ‘omic studies is a necessary next step for our field.

The goal of this activity is to determine the extent of variability in existing metatranscriptomic pipelines through a deliberate community-led intercomparison to build international confidence in methodological choices.
